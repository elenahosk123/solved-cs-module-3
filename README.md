Use  containers  from  the   STL

This  module builds    on    a    previous   module    but    is   not  part   of     the    cumulative modular  program.   <strong>Save    a     copy    of          the       previous     module</strong>  so          you       have     a   known    place  to  start     in   case     of  catastrophe!     Design    your     changes.  Review  the   design.  Then,   and   only      then,    start     coding!




In Module F you implemented a simulation of a traffic intersection using queues to hold the cars.  You will replace the queue you wrote and use the queue container from the STL.




You will run both programs with identical settings.  Compare the results.  Are they consistent?  They wonâ€™t be identical but should be within range of each other.




Is there a simple modification you can make to ensure they are doing the same calculations correctly?  HINT: it involves the seed.




NOTE:  De-allocate memory as appropriate.
